To install...

[1] Change the SQL details in the .env file
[2] Run data migration to create tables in your mysql database
[3] /welcome allows you to enter info
[4] Emails are sent in basic and not styled

Notes:

a. I have set the Messages to be both on eloquent and static functions as an example
b. The error checking is done using the html bootstrap required but obviously I could set up checking within the controller.
c. I have not styled emails and using basic SMTP to send. Obviously we could use a mailsender
d. Styling is basic and is error checking
